# Groups

Groups are used to organize content within [Colelctions](Collections.md). 

Group is purely user interface concept, it is virtual, its not persisten in the database in any form except the as part of template name. 

Group is 'created' if '/' is used in the name of the template. E.g. if the name of the template is "problem statements/oneliner/openner for investors" the phrase will be placed under "problem statements/oneliner" group and it will be displayed as "openner for investors" within the group. Note that multiple '/' in the name will not create nested groups.
