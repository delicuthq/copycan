**Price**: $5 + $2 per collection per active user.
For example, If you need to have more than 2 collections or access older versions of the phrases you pay 5 USD/mo. If you need Eve to use 2 of your collections and Adam uses just one collection, and both of them will actively use the collections, then it will cost you 6.00 additional USD per month. If Eve or Adam will not use the collection within the month then your bill will be reduced by 2 USD.
